# Crank

Crank is a gamified lifting tracker that turns your gym sessions into RPG-like progression. Track workouts, level up, and master your body.

## Features

### Dual XP System
- **Level-Points (LP)**: Earn global XP for every set you complete. Your total LP determines your overall **Character Level**.
- **Muscle-Points (MP)**: Each exercise targets specific muscle groups. Accumulate MP per muscle to track your proficiency and power across your entire physique.

### Dynamic Body Map
A front/back character silhouette that visualizes your muscle-point levels in real-time. As you train, each muscle group lights up with color intensity based on its MP level. At a glance, see which muscles are strong and which need more attention.

### Workout Tracking

- Log sets with weight and reps. The app calculates LP and MP for each set automatically.

- RPG fans who want to treat their body like the ultimate character.

## How It Works
- **Level-Points** are earned based on volume (reps × weight) and intensity. Heavier lifts and higher rep counts yield more LP.
- **Muscle-Points** are distributed based on the muscles each exercise targets. The more you train a muscle, the brighter it glows on your body map.
- **Leveling Up** occurs when you accumulate enough LP. Each level requires progressively more XP.
