        <LegalSection title="Your content">
          <P>
            You keep ownership of everything you create in the apps. You grant us
            a limited, worldwide, royalty-free licence to host, store, back up,
            and transmit that content solely to operate the service for you. That
            licence ends when you delete the content or your account, subject to
            reasonable backup retention.
          </P>
          <P>
            You are responsible for the content you upload and for having the
            rights to it. We may remove content that breaches these terms or the
            law.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Payments and subscriptions">
          <P>
            Paid features and subscriptions are sold and processed through the
            Apple App Store or Google Play unless stated otherwise in the app.
            Subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled; you can cancel at
            any time in your Apple or Google account settings, and cancellation
            takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are
            handled by the store under its own policy. Prices may change with
            notice before the change applies to you.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Availability and changes">
          <P>
            We may add, change, or discontinue features, and we may release
            updates through the app stores. We aim to give reasonable notice
            before discontinuing an app or a paid feature, and to offer a way to
            export your data where practical. The apps are not guaranteed to be
            uninterrupted or error-free.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Third-party services">
          <P>
            The apps may link to or rely on third-party services. We are not
            responsible for those services, and your use of them is governed by
            their own terms.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Termination">
          <P>
            You may stop using the apps at any time by uninstalling them and
            deleting your account. We may suspend or terminate access if you
            materially breach these terms, if required by law, or if we
            discontinue the service. Provisions on content, disclaimers,
            liability, and governing law survive termination.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Disclaimer">
          <P>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, the apps are provided
            &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo;, without
            warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and
            non-infringement.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Limitation of liability">
          <P>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for
            indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for lost
            profits or lost data. Our total aggregate liability is limited to the
            greater of the amount you paid us for the app in the 12 months before
            the claim, or CHF 50. Nothing in these terms excludes liability that
            cannot lawfully be excluded, including for death, personal injury, or
            gross negligence.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Consumer rights">
          <P>
            If you are a consumer, you keep the mandatory rights granted by the
            law of your country of residence. Nothing here limits those rights.
          </P>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Governing law">
          <P>
            These terms are governed by Swiss law, excluding its conflict of law
            rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
            of Goods. The courts of Switzerland have jurisdiction, unless
            mandatory consumer protection law in your country of residence
            provides otherwise.
